As most of us are aware, women in tech are an under represented group. Even as recent as 2023, only 26.7% of all tech related job positions are held by women. We wanted to address this issue by creating a platform where women can have access to to world class events, specially curated courses and incredible industry opportunities to help them boost their career. This platform caters to all women, whether they are just starting out, resuming their career after a long break or transitioning into a career of technology. We hope our platform will serve as a beacon of hope and motivation where we create a community of women that help each other in their journey to success.
